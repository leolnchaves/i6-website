### Ingles (traducao fiel)
1. How long does it take to put intelligence into production? — We deploy predictive intelligence into production within 4 to 12 weeks, generating measurable financial impact from the first activations, whether in revenue growth, margin protection or operational efficiency gains.
2. How to start without high investment risk? — We start with a business-oriented validation phase, using data samples to estimate impact potential before full integration. The model is progressive, allowing you to begin with a controlled scope and expand as results are proven.
3. What industries do you serve? — We serve sectors such as retail, manufacturing, finance, healthcare, pharma, education and technology, always with a direct focus on business impact and measurable results.
4. Is support ongoing? — Yes. We monitor performance, continuously adjust models and ensure constant evolution of results in production.
5. How do you ensure models keep performing over time? — We use adaptive models and continuous performance monitoring. Adjustments are made according to changes in behavior, market or strategy, maintaining consistent impact over time.
6. What is the typical ROI of your solutions? — Projects can generate up to 20x ROI in the first year, driving revenue, protecting margins and reducing operational inefficiencies.
7. What kind of data is needed to get started? — We work with the data your company already has, such as transactions, behavior, CRM and supply. We start with samples to validate potential before full integration, with models robust to data gaps.
8. Does the solution integrate with our current systems? — Yes. Our architecture is API-first and easily connects to ERPs, CRMs, e-commerce and other internal databases.
9. Do we need a data science team? — No. Our solutions are designed for business teams to operate predictive decisions without technical dependency.
10. Is the intelligence explainable and compliant with regulations? — Yes. We work with explainability layers and adherence to standards such as LGPD and GDPR, ensuring transparency and security.
11. What sets you apart from other AI companies? — We combine predictive intelligence with real-time activation. Our proprietary engines transform data into operational decisions, while i6Signal connects these insights directly to teams, converting analysis into immediate action.\n\nWe don't just deliver models. We put decisions in motion.
12. How do you measure business impact? — We work with clear revenue, margin and efficiency indicators from the start of the project, tracking variations directly attributable to predictive activations in production.
