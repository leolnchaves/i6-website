**Logo:** /content/logos/EMS-COR.png
**Segment:** Manufacturing
**Client:** EMS Pharma
**Description:** One of Brazil’s largest pharmaceutical companies and a strategic global player.
**Challenge:** The marketplace connected manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies but operated reactively, driven by incoming orders rather than anticipatory intelligence at the POS level. The lack of granular demand visibility limited sell-out potential, pressured margins and reduced efficiency in inventory and commercial capital allocation.
**Solution:** We consolidated purchase signals, transactional history, inventory and behavioral data per pharmacy into a predictive decision engine. The operation shifted from reacting to demand to actively guiding it, identifying what to sell, when to activate and which combinations would maximize turnover and margin expansion.

**Logo:** /content/logos/infinity6_CMYK_color_symbol_72dpi.png
**Segment:** Retail
**Client:** The Most Traditional Fashion Brand In Latin America
**Description:** With more than 140 years of history, the company has become one of the region’s largest fashion retailers.
**Challenge:** A significant share of digital traffic was anonymous, limiting effective personalization and impacting conversion and average order value. In addition, key cross-sell opportunities relied on manually curated outfit compositions created by fashion specialists, a process that did not scale across more than 11,000 SKUs and lacked margin optimization.
**Solution:** We transformed browsing and interaction signals into predictive intent from the first click. The model learned outfit composition patterns and introduced a strategic dimension: intelligent prioritization of lower-rotation and higher-margin SKUs. Real-time activation enabled contextual recommendations for both logged-in and anonymous users, scaling curated commerce with commercial intelligence.
**Metric1:** +2.6% Higher Sales Vs. Traditional Curated Looks (With Only 5% Of Traffic)
